# Better API

A project that makes working with REST APIs easier. It does so by introducing a declarative syntax used to
declare an API, and providing the tools for parsing, validating, and generating code from the API specification. See
[design docs](docs/design.md) for more detailed motivation and goals of the project.

> [!NOTE]
> The project is still very much WIP.

The Better API syntax is described in the [syntax.md](docs/syntax.md).
